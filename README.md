> A Terraform module for creating Amazon [ECS Task Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html)

## NOTICE

**THIS MODULE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERSIONS OF TERRAFORM LESS THAN v0.12.x. PLEASE REFER TO THE OFFICIAL [DOCUMENTATION](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html) FOR UPGRADING TO THE LATEST VERSION OF TERRAFORM.**

## Motivation

The purpose of this module is to generate a valid Amazon [ECS Task Definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html) dynamically. A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. A task definition contains a list of [container definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definitions) received by the Docker daemon to create a container instance.

### Use Cases

- Have Terraform generate valid task definitions dynamically
- Update the ECS task definition and trigger new [service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) deployments automatically (see [examples/ecs_update_service.tf](examples/ecs_update_service.tf))

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (for testing)

## Usage

This module uses the same parameters as the [`ContainerDefinition`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html) object. Given the following Terraform configuration:

```hcl
provider "aws" {}

module "mongo-task-definition" {
  source = "github.com/mongodb/terraform-aws-ecs-task-definition"

  family = "mongo"
  image  = "mongo:3.6"
  memory = 512
  name   = "mongo"

  portMappings = [
    {
      containerPort = 27017
    },
  ]
}
```

Invoking the commands defined below creates an ECS task definition with the following [`containerDefinitions`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterTaskDefinition.html#ECS-RegisterTaskDefinition-request-containerDefinitions):

    $ terraform init
    $ terraform apply

```json

    "cpu": null,
    "disableNetworking": false,
    "dnsSearchDomains": null,
    "dnsServers": null,

    "links": null,
    "linuxParameters": null,
    "logConfiguration": null,
    "memory": 512,
    "memoryReservation": null,
    "mountPoints": null,
    "name": "mongo",
    "portMappings": [{"containerPort":27017}],
    "privileged": false,
    "pseudoTerminal": false,
    "readonlyRootFilesystem": false,
    "repositoryCredentials": null,
    "resourceRequirements": null,
    "secrets": null,
    "systemControls": null,
    "ulimits": null,
    "user": null,
    "volumesFrom": null,
    "workingDirectory": null
  }
]
```

### Multiple Container Definitions

By default, this module creates a task definition with a single container definition. To create a task definition with multiple container definitions, refer to the documentation of the [`merge`](modules/merge) module.
